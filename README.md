## Features of the Project

- **User Interface:**
  - Users can send money and receive from other users.
  - All the users are displayed in the Dashboard section.
  - Secured Transaction takes place between the user with the help of sessions.
  - Users must log in to access the website, and new users can sign up for an account.
  - Token authentication is considered for sending money and signup or sign in.
  - A successful transfer message is shown to the user after the transaction is completed.

## Tech Stack

- **MongoDB:**
  - MongoDB serves as the database management system, storing various data related to user details available on the platform, such as First names, Last names, username/email, and password. MongoDB's flexibility allows storing this data without a fixed schema, accommodating the diverse nature of user information.

- **React:**
  - React is utilized for building the front end of the Paytm website. It enables the creation of interactive user interfaces, allowing users to seamlessly browse through the Dashboard, view user details, and interact with the platform's features. React's component-based architecture facilitates the development of reusable UI components, ensuring consistency and efficiency across the website.

- **Node.js:**
  - Node.js powers the backend of the project, handling server-side logic and communication with the database. It enables the implementation of features such as user authentication, user management, and API endpoints for frontend-backend interaction. Node.js's event-driven, non-blocking I/O model ensures the efficient handling of concurrent operations, making the website responsive and scalable.

- **Express:**
  - Express complements Node.js by providing a minimalist web framework for building server-side applications and APIs. In this project, Express is used to define routes, middleware, and other backend functionalities. It simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, processing data, and generating responses. Express's lightweight nature and extensive middleware ecosystem streamline backend development, accelerating the creation of a robust backend infrastructure for this project.
